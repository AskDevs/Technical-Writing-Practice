## Editing

The purpose of editing is to ensure that your ideas are presented to your reader as clearly as possible. Best way to do it is by means of a checklist:

- Use of present tense and active voice
- Unnecessary words
- Gender-neutral wording.
- Lower, mixed, and upper case combinations. Check if the title is consistent across the document.
- Numbering, ensure the task starts with numbers
- Procedures, the steps/procedures should start with verbs (action verbs).
- Misspelled words (do not rely solely on a spell checker).
- Correct use of punctuation
- Bulleted and numbered lists have parallel construction and consistent punctuation.
- Numbers, spell out isolated numbers from one to ten.
- apostrophe (‚Äò), Find every apostrophe (‚Äò) and replace all contractions with the fully spelled out words, for example, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù becomes ‚Äúdo not.‚Äù
- En dash -, em dash ‚Äî , and noun groups, use them correctly.
- And and or, no sentence should use and /or together.
- Hyperlinks, check if all hyperlinks work.
