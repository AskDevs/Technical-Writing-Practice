## Day 7

We are on our final day of the challenge.

If you have come this far with us, I am extremely grateful and hope that this challenge has kickstarted your journey into technical writing.

Today, we will be publishing our article on a platform

Let's dive in! ðŸš€

## Publishing

For publishing your blog post you have primarily two options:

ðŸ”¹ **Blogging platforms** They offer an convenient way to publish articles and audience for your blog. However they have limit your blog design and monetization options.

ðŸ”¹ **Self publishing** It comes with the freedom of choosing content and design of your blog but requires technical skills and effort to setup and maintain a website.

For beginners I highly recommend to start with blogging platforms and move to your own blog once you have an audience. Having said that, I have listed options for both choices with guidance on how to publish the article.
