## Create An Outline

Outlines help you organize your thoughts, ideas, or research regarding a topic.

Simply put, an outline is a detailed overview of your article.

**Example**

For blogpost with title *10 Tools Every Web Developer Should Know* ‚Äî the outline can go something like this:

- Introduction
 - Tool 1
 - Tool 2
 - ...
 - Tool 10
- Conclusion

A good outline organizes the information such that it's easy to follow for the readers.

### Practical Tips üí° 

- For outline ideas refer outline of similar blogposts on [DEV](https://dev.to) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com).
- Ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.apps.openai.com/) using prompt *Provide the blog sections for topic: <article topic>*

## Research

Now that you have logically ordered main points of your article. It's time to find supporting details (experience, links, images, quotes, or examples) for those points.

You can do research in 4 steps:
1. Refine your point and identify keywords.
2. Identify relevant sources.
3. Use google search techniques to make queries to the source.
4. Document results in your article outline.

**Example**

If you are collecting details for the point *Advantages Of Docker*, your research will look something like this:

| Research Step | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| Keywords | `Docker Advantages` |
| Relevant Source | `DevOpsSchool.com` |
| Google Query | `site:DevOpsSchool.com Docker Advantages` |

### Practical Tipsüí° 

- Learn [Google Search Techniques](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html) and [prompt engineering](https://prompts.chat) for ChatGPT.
- Ask questions in dev communities (StackOverflow, Twitter, Discord) if you don't find what you are looking for.
- Collect relevant visual aids like images, GIFs and memes (without overdoing it) to make your article visually appealing.
