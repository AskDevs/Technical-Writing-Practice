## Drafting‚ÄîThe Process

> Drafting ‚Äîput into practice your technical writing skills

This is the step where you really get into action. 
As a technical writer, you must always consider the user, and adopt an action-oriented ‚Äî or ‚Äútask-oriented‚Äù ‚Äî approach, bearing in mind that your reader is a user who is looking to accomplish a task. 
Also, always keep an eye on your style and use writing techniques suited to a possible subsequent translation.

### Write the first draft.
The goal of the first draft is to help you get all of the ideas in your head onto paper.

* Write down all of the ideas that come to you in relation to your outline. 
* It doesn't have to look good or even be moderately ready for publishing. Write, then fix later.

While writing out this draft, you may likely get stuck on some areas. That's perfectly normal. This might indicate that you need to stop and go do more research or consult someone knowledgeable about the topic.

Alternatively, mark the section that needs to be worked on as Todo and continue writing the sections that you flow freely to you.

### Rewrite the first draft
The goal of this rewrite is to organize all of the ideas that were jumbled together in your first draft into a coherent and presentable format.

In this phase, you should arrange paragraphs and sentences one after the other to achieve flow and remove any awkward phrases or duplicate information. It would help if you also wrote a proper intro and outro.

Your intro should answer the question: "Will this help me?, Should I be reading this?". It needs to contain the goal of the content (what the user will learn from the content), and any prerequisites knowledge they need to have.

In contrast, your outro should include the next steps for the reader (what should they do next after reading your article). This can include anything from relevant links to additional resources.

Asides that, here's a list of other things to do in the rewrite phase:

* Rewrite every paragraph and section with the key ideas positioned first, to promote readability.
* Remove anything that doesn't support your main point or will distract from key points.
* Verify that there are no gaps in your writing and that you've provided all the information the reader needs to arrive at the goal set out at the beginning.

### Practical Tips üí° 
Typically I'd say put some distance between your first draft and every rewrite. If you can afford the luxury of time, the next day is best. This allows you to have a fresh perspective and brain.
