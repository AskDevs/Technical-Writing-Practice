## Pick a Topic
Coming up with article topics is easy — if you answer these 3 questions right:

- **What do I know well?**
- **Who can benefit from it?**
- **How can I help them?**

For example, if you are a react developer, answer to above questions might look like:
- **What do I know well?**
*React*
- **Who can benefit from it?**
*Beginner frontend developers*
- **How can I help them?**
*By sharing list of tools a react developer should know.*

Answering these pointed questions, will give you good idea of what you want to write about. 

If not satisfied with the topic - repeat the exercise with another idea.

### Practical Tips 💡 
- Use technical article sites (like [DEV](https://dev.to), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com)) for inspiration. Filter by your topic. E.g you can find articles on react on DEV using hashtag [like this](https://dev.to/t/react).
- See what questions are readers asking in the comments for ideas. - Discover trending questions on your topic on [AnswerSocrates](https://answersocrates.com).

## Write a Headline
Now that you have a topic, writing the blog headline comes next.

Headline is the first thing your readers will see when they come across your post.

As writers our job is to make it clear and worth clicking.

Thankfully, there are AI powered tools to help us with that.

### Practical Tips💡 

- Use the [headline generator tool](http://www.articleideagenerator.com/) from [@olanetsoft](https://github.com/Olanetsoft). In the search box mention your topic.
- Ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.apps.openai.com/) with the following prompt - "Generate 10 headlines and titles for technical blog post on topic <your topic>"
