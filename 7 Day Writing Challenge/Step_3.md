### Make an outline
> An outline, in simple terms, is a skeleton of a finished piece of writing that maps the topics you will cover in an article.

Determining article format and structure in step one will help you create an article outline.
Outlining the content of your document before expanding on it helps you write in a more focused way. It also lets you organize your thoughts and achieving your goals for your writing.

An outline can also help you identify what you want your readers to get out of the document. And finally, it establishes a timeline for completing your writing.
