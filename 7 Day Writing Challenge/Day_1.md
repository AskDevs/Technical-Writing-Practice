# ✍️ 7 Day Writing Challenge

## 🔊 Announcing Our 7 Day Writing Challenge

I'm really excited to announce our 7 Day Technical Writing Challenge, which we're beginning next week!

This challenge will help you kickstart a daily habit of writing. If you want to start a technical blog, this writing challenge is for you.

What makes this even more fun is that we’re going to do the challenge together as a community.

If you join, each day you will be guided with procedural steps to follow on each day.

Are you in? 

## 📝 Challenge Rules 

**🔶 Topic/Idea**: The challenge will begin the day after you sign up.
And pick a topic/title (pick up a domain and stick to it).

**🔶 Research**: brainstorm ideas or look up on web for more information and resources.

**🔶 Drafting**: Write the first draft and have a intro, middle and end.

**🔶 Editing**:Use tools to check up on grammar and any corrections. At the end of each day, you’ll let us know how did you wrote that day.

**🔶 Review**: At this stage, the article should be around 75% complete. Well Done! The first draft is complete.We will pick your blog for review and feedback will be shared.

**🔶 Publish nad Share**: Now that you have the idea, the goal, the structure, and some feedback, it’s time to polish everything up and ship it. Once you’ve actually published the post, you’re not done! If you want people to see what you’ve written and get value out of it, make sure to share it in the places where your audience is likely to hang out.  


> At the end of the 7 days, you’ll have written your first blogpost! More importantly, you have begun your writing habit!
