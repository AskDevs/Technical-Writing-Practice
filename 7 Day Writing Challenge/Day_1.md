### 📍 Picking something to write about
Decide Why You Want to Write
It may sound like an obvious tip, but it's worth checking in with yourself: do you know exactly what you want to gain by writing your article?

One of the best ways to narrow it down is to consider why exactly you're writing: what's your end goal?
Once you have that firmly in mind, what you should write about becomes much more apparent, at least in general terms.

**For example:**

🔶 If you just want to practice your writing, try and start with the topics that interest you, even if you're not an expert.

🔶 If you're writing to learn something specific, you can stop reading. You've answered your question. 

🔶 If you're writing to show your competence, focus on what you know a lot about and feel confident writing about.

Your best writing usually comes from topics you're genuinely interested in. Confirming your personal reason brings a lot of clarity. 

> More importantly, what I really want you to write about is something that is personal and important to you.

Maybe you've always wanted to learn about web automation, CSS art, or game development. Do some research into your interests, and pick something to write from there. This is how I picked up to write and document around Tailwind CSS alongside incorporating it into my projects.

Some of examples of blogs I recently wrote:
* Become a Frontend web developer in 2023 - A step by step guide
* Breaking out of tutorial hell
* Importance of soft skills in technical roles
* Why your GitHub profile should stand out?

Remember, the goal is to provide value to your readers, so choose topics that are relevant and useful to readers.

### 📍 Brainstorm Ideas
You can brainstorm in a bunch of different ways, here's the approach to it that works best for me:

🔶 Get a pen and paper.

🔶 Write down every topic idea that comes to your mind, even if you think it's a bad idea.Keep going until you can't think of anything else.

🔶 If you've found an idea you're happy with, stop.

🔶 If you haven't, look for some more input. You can ask people for suggestions, check out things other people have written, or do some research on the ideas you already have.

🔶 Repeat until you have ideas you're happy with.

These questions also help you think about a topic for writing.
