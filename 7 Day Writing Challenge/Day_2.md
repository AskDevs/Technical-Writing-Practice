## 🔶 Day 2. Topic/Idea

The challenge will begin the day after you sign up.
And pick a topic/title (pick up a domain and stick to it).

### 📍 Here are some steps you can follow to generate ideas for technical writing:

* Identify your audience: Who are you writing for and what kind of information do they need? What are their pain points, questions, and challenges?

* Ask for feedback from peers and colleagues: Ask for feedback from other experts in your field to see what topics they would be interested in reading about.

* Answer common questions: What are the most frequently asked questions in your field? Write about these topics to provide valuable information to your readers.

* Turn challenges into opportunities: What challenges do your readers face in their work or daily lives? Write about ways to overcome these challenges and provide solutions.

* Share your expertise: Write about what you know best - your experiences, your insights, and your expert knowledge.

* Review and analyze existing content: Look at what has been written before in your field, and write about a different angle or a more in-depth analysis.

Remember, the goal is to provide value to your readers, so choose topics that are relevant and useful to readers.

### 📍 Brainstorm Ideas
> One of the best ways to generate ideas of any kind is brainstorming. The more ideas you can come up with, the great your chances are of finding a good one.

You can brainstorm in a bunch of different ways, including as a group, but here's the approach to it that works best for me:

* Get a pen and paper.
* Write down every topic idea that comes to your mind, even if you think it's a bad idea.Keep going until you can't think of anything else.
* If you've found an idea you're happy with, stop.
* If you haven't, look for some more input. You can ask people for suggestions, check out things other people have written, or do some research on the ideas you already have.
* Repeat until you have ideas you're happy with.

These questions also help you think about a topic for writing.
