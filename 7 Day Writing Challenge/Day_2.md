## ðŸ”¶ Day 1. Topic/Idea

The challenge will begin the day after you sign up.
And pick a topic/title (pick up a domain and stick to it).

### Brainstorm Ideas
> One of the best ways to generate ideas of any kind is brainstorming. The more ideas you can come up with, the great your chances are of finding a good one.

You can brainstorm in a bunch of different ways, including as a group, but here's the approach to it that works best for me:
1. Get a pen and paper.
2. Write down every topic idea that comes to your mind, even if you think it's a bad idea.
3. Keep going until you can't think of anything else.
4. If you've found an idea you're happy with, stop.
5. If you haven't, look for some more input. You can ask people for suggestions, check out things other people have written, or do some research on the ideas you already have.
6. Take a break of some kind. Sleep for a while, go for a walk, or work on something else for at least 30 minutes.
7. Get a new piece of paper, and write your ideas on it until you can't think of anything else.
8. Repeat until you have ideas you're happy with.

These questions also help you think about a topic for writing, which we'll talk about more in [Day_2](https://github.com/AskDevs/Technical-Writing-Practice/blob/0a9c48aae0da5f16d64e954d3fa26bc55b2500ed/7%20Day%20Writing%20Challenge/Day_2.md).
